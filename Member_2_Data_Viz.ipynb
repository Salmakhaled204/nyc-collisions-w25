        "- **Daily trends:** Crash counts show consistent day-to-day fluctuations, with occasional spikes likely related to weather, traffic surges, or special events.\n",
        "- **Monthly trends:** Certain months exhibit noticeably higher crash volumes, reflecting seasonal driving conditions or population activity patterns.\n",
        "- **Hourly distribution:** Crashes peak during **morning rush hours (7–9 AM)** and **evening rush hours (4–7 PM)**. The lowest crash frequencies occur after midnight, when road activity is minimal.\n",

        "- Trucks, buses, and motorcycles appear less frequently but exhibit distinct patterns in certain boroughs.\n",
