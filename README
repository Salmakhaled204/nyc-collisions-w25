As Member 5, I was fully responsible for designing, building, and deploying the complete interactive dashboard required for Milestone 1. This included connecting the final dataset, implementing dynamic filtering, adding search functionality, creating multiple visualizations, and deploying the final version publicly.

1. Responsibilities
A. Dashboard Architecture & Data Connection

Loaded the final integrated dataset (merged_final.parquet) directly inside the Hugging Face Space for 100% reliability.

Implemented automatic column detection logic to handle any column-name inconsistencies using substring matching.

Engineered supplemental features such as:

Age groups

Weekday extraction

Clean injury categories

B. UI/UX Development

Built the entire Dash layout using Bootstrap for responsiveness.

Applied a consistent pastel-themed color palette across all elements.

Designed a clean layout containing:

Header

Filter section

Search section

Generate Report button

KPI card

Visualization rows

C. Interactive Filters

Implemented all required filters with multi-select support:

Borough

Year

Vehicle Type

Contributing Factor

Age Group

Each filter updates the dataset dynamically through the callback.

D. Keyword Search Mode

Designed a flexible search system that:

Splits user text into tokens

Searches across multiple columns

Combines keyword filters with dropdowns

Works with the Generate Report button

This meets the “search mode” requirement of Milestone 1.

E. Generate Report Button

Built the central callback that recomputes:

All visualizations

KPIs

Map data

Heatmap pivot table

All filtered subsets

Ensured each press updates the entire dashboard in real time.

F. Interactive Visualizations

Created a diverse set of graphs that satisfy all milestone requirements:

Bar chart — Crashes per borough

Line chart — Crashes over time

Heatmap — Hour × Weekday crash density

Mapbox scatter map — Crash locations (sampled for performance)

Pie chart — Injury severity distribution

KPI metrics — total collisions, persons involved, average age

All charts are style-unified using a central style_fig() function.

G. Deployment

Deployed the entire dashboard on Hugging Face Spaces.

Uploaded the dataset directly into the Space for guaranteed loading.

Ensured the app runs instantly with no external dependencies.

2. Research Questions (Member 5)
RQ9:

How do crash patterns across hours and weekdays change when focusing on specific boroughs and vehicle types, and what time–day combinations show the highest crash density under each scenario?

RQ10:

How does the distribution of injury severity differ between pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicle occupants when applying different keywords and borough filters?


3. ✅ Answer to RQ9:

RQ9:
How do crash patterns across hours and weekdays change when focusing on specific boroughs and vehicle types, and what time–day combinations show the highest crash density under each scenario?

Answer:

Filtering the dataset by borough and vehicle type revealed consistent temporal patterns. In all tested scenarios (“Brooklyn SUV”, “Manhattan Taxi”, and “Queens Motorcycle”), crashes peaked between 12 PM and 7 PM, especially on Monday, Thursday, and Friday. The heatmaps showed strong afternoon and early-evening clusters regardless of borough or vehicle type. The map visualizations also confirmed location-specific clustering: Brooklyn displayed widespread activity, Manhattan showed dense linear patterns along major avenues, and Queens had a broad distribution of motorcycle-related crashes. KPI results further showed that filtered crash counts vary by borough, with Brooklyn returning the highest counts. These findings demonstrate that crash density is influenced by both time-of-day and borough-specific traffic patterns.

✅ Answer to RQ10:

RQ10:
How does the distribution of injury severity differ between pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicle occupants when applying different keywords and borough filters?

Answer:

Filtering the dataset by road-user type revealed clear differences in injury severity. Pedestrians showed a notable proportion of confirmed injuries (41%) and a small fatality share. Cyclist-related crashes, although fewer in number, displayed the highest injury percentage (67%), highlighting their vulnerability. Drivers experienced the lowest confirmed injury rate, with most records marked as “unknown,” suggesting milder outcomes or incomplete reporting. Elderly pedestrians (60+) had the most severe outcomes: nearly 70% injured and the highest fatality percentage (3.6%). These results indicate that injury severity is strongly influenced by both road-user type and age, with vulnerable groups—especially cyclists and older pedestrians—experiencing the worst outcomes.
